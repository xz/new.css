## FAQ

**Why should I use this instead of (popular framework)?**

new.css wasn't made to be a true framework. It's made for rapidly prototyping your raw HTML or setting up a good-looking simple HTML site with zero configuration.

**Does this work with (platform/service)?**

new.css was designed to work with nothing but raw HTML, but some awesome community members are porting it to other platforms. 

Check if your platform or service supports custom CSS. If it does, it'll probably work. You're welcome to [ask the community](https://discord.gg/hhuuC4w) as well.

**Will this make my website mobile-friendly?

Yes, using new.css as a framework for your website will allow it to be mobile-friendly.
All themes, including customized ones, are mobile-friendly.

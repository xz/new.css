# new.css

A classless CSS framework to write modern websites using only HTML. It weighs **4.8kb**.

All it does is set some sensible defaults and styles your HTML to look reasonable. It's perfect for:

- A dead-simple blog
- Collecting your most used links
- Making a simple "about me" site
- Rendering markdown-generated HTML
- Creating a quick simple website

**Demo: [newcss.net](https://newcss.net/?ref=github_demo)**

new.css is also a great source for novice web developers.

The simplicity of new.css allows it to be a hands-on and easy-to-understand learning resource for beginners learning CSS and HTML

## FAQ

**Why should I use this instead of (popular framework)?**

new.css wasn't made to be a true framework. It's made for rapidly prototyping your raw HTML or setting up a good-looking simple HTML site with zero configuration.

**Does this work with (platform/service)?**

new.css was designed to work with nothing but raw HTML, but some awesome community members are porting it to other platforms. 

Check if your platform or service supports custom CSS. If it does, it'll probably work. You're welcome to [ask the community](https://discord.gg/hhuuC4w) as well.

**Will this make my website mobile-friendly?**

Yes, using new.css as a framework for your website will allow it to be mobile-friendly.

All themes, including customized ones, are mobile-friendly.
